# Robust Genetics Optimization

This repository is split four parts. The main Jupyter notebook which walks through how standard and robust optimization work for genetic selection from start to finish, part of which is [Example/](Example/), a realistic simulated example from Gregor Gorjanc and Ivan PocrniÄ‡. We also have [Scratch/](Scratch/), a mix of Jupyter notebooks used as part of working out the problem with some additional data files and example scripts. Finally we have [Writing/](Writing/), a more formal writeup of the notebook and its findings in LaTeX (written by Julian, currently housed in Overleaf).
