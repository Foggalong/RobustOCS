# Robust Genetics Optimization

This repository is split two parts. First we have [Code/](Code/), primarily a Jupyter notebook walking through robust optimization for genetic selection with some additional data files and example scripts. We also have [Writing/](Writing/), a more formal writeup of the notebook and its findings in LaTeX.
