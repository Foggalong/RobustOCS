# AlphaRGS

Tools for solving robust genetics selection problems in Python. It depends on Python 3.10+, [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) via [gurobipy](https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/).  

## Structure

This repository is split four parts. As well as the module in [`alphargs/`](alphargs/), there's [`Example/`](Example/) which includes a realistic simulated example from Gregor Gorjanc and Ivan PocrniÄ‡. We also have [Scratch/](Scratch/) which includes a notebook which walks through how standard and robust optimization work for genetic selection from start to finish. Finally we have [Writing/](Writing/), a more formal writeup of the notebook and its findings in LaTeX (written by Julian, currently housed in Overleaf).
