# Code

The main piece in this folder is the [Jupyter notebook](robust-notes.ipynb) which walks through how robust optimization for genetic selection is carried out from start to finish, created while I was working that out for myself. As part of this [example2.ped](example2.ped) is a pedigree data file for a small example.

There's also [simple-point.m](simple-point.m) and [simple-robust.m](simple-robust.m) which demonstrate how to carry out normal and robust optimization (respectively) for genetics using MATLAB.
