# How to contribute to RobustOCS

Welcome! This document explains some of the ways you can contribute to RobustOCS.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Raise Issues

Whether it's about the documentation or the package, you can raise issues with RobustOCS in the normal way via [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). Please [open via a template](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS/issues/new/choose) and check nobody else has opened a [similar issue](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before submitting.

## Improve Documentation

The [documentation](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS/wiki) is hosted using GitHub wikis, which do not support [pull requests](https://stackoverflow.com/q/10642928). To submit an improvement or change, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS/issues/new?labels=documentation&template=documentation.md) and include the markdown for what you would like to be included.

## Contribute Code

RobustOCS is open source and anyone is welcome to submit fixes or improvements. That said, the package relates to an ongoing research project and as such changes which impact that work may not be accepted.  If your contribution is more than a minor fix, please open a [bug report](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.md&title=) or [feature request](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature-request.md&title=) to discuss your suggestions first.

Note that since RobustOCS is MIT licensed, any contributions submitted will also be released under the MIT license.
